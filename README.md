# codondiffR

An R package for the calculation and visualisation of codon usage metrics in user-supplied protein-coding nucleotide sequences, and the comparison of these metrics with those of reference taxa. The package is designed primarily for the analysis of viral open reading frames (ORFs), with the intention of identifying potential host taxa based on overall codon usage similarity, but it can be used for any protein-coding input sequence.

## Getting Started

To install codondiffR, run the following commands in R:
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adamd3/codondiffR")
```
